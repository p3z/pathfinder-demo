          <h2>Why teams use Pathfinder</h2>
          <p>
            Pathfinder gives you a reliable way to go from “we have an idea” to “we know exactly what to build” without
            long email threads, lost notes, or conflicting documents.

            <h3>Less rework, more delivery</h3>
            <p>
              By separating stakeholder intent, technical design, and implementation tasks, Pathfinder reduces costly
              misalignment between business and engineering.

                guides the conversation with clarifying questions and gradually fills out a Task Definition Document.

            <summary>Is Pathfinder a replacement for our project management tool?</summary>
            <p>
              Pathfinder focuses on defining what should be built, not tracking every task. Many teams use it alongside
              their existing ticketing or project management tools.

            <summary>Do stakeholders need to understand technical details?</summary>
            <p>
              No. Stakeholders can describe goals and constraints in plain language. Pathfinder and your developers then
              translate that into a technical plan.

            <p>
              Because every decision and clarification is captured in Task Definition Documents and project history, it
              is easier to show what was agreed, when, and why.

            <summary>Can we export our work if we move to another tool?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Each project can be exported as a complete directory containing Task Definition Documents, build
              outputs, preview data, and supporting files.
